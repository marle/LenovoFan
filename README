LenovoFan is a simple python script to adjust CPU fan speed. It is designed for
Lenovo SL laptop series known for their noisy fans.

To use it you must have Tetromino's driver installed:
http://github.com/tetromino/lenovo-sl-laptop. Script is adding a tray icon with
a few options to adjust fan speed. By default automatic fan control is enabled.
Script is monitoring CPU temperature and when it gets hotter than 75 C it
switches back to BIOS control of the fan.
Anyway, I suggest installing GNOME Sensors Applet to monitor temperatures at the
beginning.

You have to run the script as root to allow modification of pwm1 and pwm1_enable
files.
